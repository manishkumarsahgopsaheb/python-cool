all the time actually we dont need of installing xamp for creating a local server. why?

the answer is simple, we can simply create a pyhton http server and its creation is more easy  and simple than installing xamp 
or installing Aapache and Mysql

why to create local server:
    becase it is good to keep the file on server rather than in local memory
    and after all we have to push our files on the server for hosting our website
    and also reason is :
          like if we will not create server then it may different browser treats different behaviour with our files

step to creating python http server:

1) just go in the folder where your all files is present related to your website
2)click shift key and right mouse button together,
              you will get the option like
              ----- open powershell window here---------------,
              click on this option and your window power shell will open here
3)now type
        python -m http.server --bind=localhost
        
        after this output will be like
              Servering Http on 127.0.0.1 port 8000 (http://127.0.0.1:8000)....
              
4)or instead of typing the command in step 3, you can type this:
      python -m http.server
      
5) go into the browser and type localhost:8000 and hit enter, you will get your server
